# ##############################    FIRST STEPS    #############################################################
#
# This is one of my current config files for yt-dlp. it works but you will probably want to customise yourself.
# Use the --ignore-config flag for (Playlists | ASCII Art | Metadata. I suggest looking at these settings).    #
#
# if you want thumbnails replace all mentions of thumbnail in this file with     --convert-thumbnails webp for the smallest lossless filesize                                                                               
# --proxy |URl| NOT REQUIRED STRONGLY ADVISED
# --geobypass for files blocked by your country so if you don't know LEARN - all in the manual. This setting is for pentesting. Make sure you know the laws in your country - this config is open source as is yt-dlp
# --ffmpeg-location (read the manual section for FFMPEG postprocessing)
#  --split-chapters more files more organising
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# <cmd>$yt-dlp--dump-user-agent -s |DRYRUN FOR CONFIG

# DOWNLOAD SETTINGS

--progress
--check-formats
--fixup warn
## Path - I have gone with my music folder. It will make dir so won't overwrite your music folder if existing.
--paths $HOME/music 
--output (title).%(ext)s
### good alternatives audio: yt-dlp --parse-metadata "title:%(artist)s - %(title)s" | video yt-dlp --parse-metadata "title:%(artist)s - %(title)s"         $ yt-dlp --parse-metadata "%(series)s S%(season)(episode_number):%(title)s""
--windows-filenames
# --no-write-playlist-metafiles
# Number of seconds to sleep/dl | macro best practices are to act human 
--min-sleep-interval 2
--max-sleep-interval 5
# Number of fragments during download (default is 1, 2-8 is the sweetspot on this system, too high and you will slow down or break)
--concurrent-fragments 4
# buffer size MAXIMUM QUALITY MAXIMUM SIZE. Remove or reduce this flag to improve speed and reduce data
--buffer-size 22k
--no-resize-buffer
-fps 30 #for video unlikely to require more - most TV have 24 - 30 FPS and that is perfect for most use cases


# VIDEO SETTINGS 
## Subtitle settings - Worth noting if you are charged on data or limited by size or speed do you need subs? (I do, but not thumbnails)
# --all-subs
# --embed-subs
--no-write-thumbnail
## Warn conflicts but don't break - error logging optional see <cmd>$ man yt-dlp
--default-search auto_warning 
# PLAYLIST Replace with |--playlist| for that case (Automation coming v2 - lots of config flags for playlists)
--no-playlist
# --embed-chapters --REQUIRES METADATA CAN CREATE BLOAT ENSURE YOU KEEP THIS LEGAL 

## Misc / personal

## 0 (b)est 10 (w)orst | postprocessing required

## --audio-quality b # SAME AS 10 IF YOU HAVE SLOW INTERNET OR ARE NOT BOTHERED BY QUALITY FIND YOUR OWN SWEET SPOT 

## -V # (VERBOSE - DEBUG ON FIRST USE STRONGLY ADVISED)can be commented out after the first use but if you have errors you should have all the tools to fix them. 

##  --extract-audio  # personal most used case, FFMPEG and it's config file advised

##  --no-embed-subs
